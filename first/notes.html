        <p>HTML 5 brought in lots of elements that are not functional, but allow
            us to be symantic in what we write - very clear what that piece of 
            code does / what content it contains.</p>
        <p>Be symantic when you code - make it clear what you are doing</p>

            This is a div - it is used for everything that where no symantic 
            tag exists.
